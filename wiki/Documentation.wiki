== wifi_monitor basic documentation ==

overview:
    This program is used to execute an HTTP(S) POST when associating to a 
    particular SSID, ie logging you in through a web authentication system once
    you associate to the campus wifi network.

installation:
    Double-click on the install.command file, enter the requested information, 
    then provide your password so that the program can be installed in a 
    system directory.  The info required is as follows -
        * SSID: the particular SSID which you want to take action on when 
            associating to it
        * login URL: the URL you want the program to send data to when 
            associating to the selected SSID
        * POST data: the POST data you want to send to the login URL when 
            associating to the selected SSID

uninstallation:
    Double-click on the uninstall.command file and enter your password.

usage:
    The program will launch at each login and run in the background.

configuration:
    If you want to change the preferences after installing, run the program
    manually from Terminal like so (the -v option will give extra feedback),
    using only the preference flags you wish to change -
        wifi_monitor -v -storePrefs {prefs}
        
        {prefs}=
            * -ssid=SOME_SSID
            * -login_url=SOME_URL
            * -post_data=SOME_DATA
            * -interface=enX
            * -ip_version=X
    Example for changing the SSID to "super_hax":
        wifi_monitor -storePrefs -ssid=super_hax
